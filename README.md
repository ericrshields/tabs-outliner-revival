## Tabs-Outliner Revival
This has served as my favorite tab organization tool for many years now - nothing else has compared! Unforunately, the addon seems to be abandoned now.

### This is a Fan Update
Ironincally, one of the main things I wanted to fix was my ability to actually pay the author! It constantly told me that I wasn't logged in when I tried to pay. I do not and will never seek payment for this update, and the ability to pay the original author is still present. Ideally, I will fully fix the code so that only people that have paid the original author can leverage the full addon.

The fixes are very rough and I make no promises that this version will work for anyone else. To try it, install as a local developement addon. Make sure to back everything up, especially your tree, first!
